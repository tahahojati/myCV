\begin{cvletter}

It is my pleasure to submit my resume for the advertised software engineer position. I recently graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) with a bachelor’s of science in physics. Due to my interest to computer science, I have engaged in learning and implementing computer programming in the last four years.

I first learned computer programming, C++, and web development in high school.  In my freshman and sophomore years at UHM, I worked in a bioinformatics lab as an assistant analyst. During that time, my responsibility was to design and maintain a MySQL database of genetic elements and to create a public front end for it using PHP programming language on an Apache web server. As part of my education at UHM, I took courses in Java Programing, Algorithm Analysis, and Discreet Mathematics from Computer Science Department at UHM.  Last April, I completed an online degree on Udacity.com focused on Front-End web development using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. As part of this program, I was also introduced to techniques of website optimization.  Currently I work as an application developer for CRDG office at UH Manoa where I have developed a database backed web application for a citizen science project.  I have provided links to some of my projects on my personal portfolio website at: tahahojati.github.io.

I am passionate about writing beautiful and bug free code and I believe I would be great addition to your group.
