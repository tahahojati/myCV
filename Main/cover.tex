It is my pleasure to submit my resume for the [position] position. I am a physics graduate and a self-taught developer and I think I may be the hire that you are looking for.  

%I first learned programming (C++) in high school.  Then, and in
In college, I was interested in the applications of computing in sciences.  In my freshman and sophomore years, I worked in a bioinformatics lab, trying to computationally date the genetic mutations in the genome of maize. During that time, I wrote numerous programs using a mix of C, Perl, and R.  I also learned php to create a website to showcase our findings.  
Later, I used my programming knowledge to write a GUI software using C++ and Root platform for analyzing data gleaned from a physics experiment.  The experiment aimed to discover dark matter; unfortunately, no luck!

Since graduation, I have been working and gaining experience as a developer for several companies,  
%I have learned more in the last years than I initially thought was there to learn! %this line emphasizes my willingness to learn
have supplemented my education by taking online courses covering Android development, algorithm analysis, OS design, and AWS. I have also challenged myself by participating in Hackathons and by completing personal projects in my free time. You can find a list of my certificates in my resume and you may view some of my projects on my website at \textbf{\href{http://www.tpourjalali.com}{tpourjalali.com}}.


Thank you in advance for your consideration.  I look forward to talking further with you about how my background might fit your company's current needs.


%Dear Sir / Madam,

%Let me start by saying that I love Google and that just writing this letter excites me.   I get inspired by Google products everyday.  I was inspired by the extremely neat implementation of dependency injection in Angular and after years, I am still in awe of Google Sheets and how your company developed such a strong software using only JavaScript (as it was in 2007). 
%I am physics graduate from the University of Hawaii.  I have not always been a developer, but I have loved programming for a long time.  I taught my self C++ from a book before graduating from high school.  In my freshman and sophomore years in UHM, I worked in a bioinformatics lab as an assistant research assistant. During that time, my responsibility was to design and maintain a MySQL database of genetic elements and to create a public front end for it using php on an Apache web server.  During my college education, I took online and on campus classes in algorithm design and analysis, machine learning, and full stack development.  Since graduating last May, I have focused on learning and adopting new development technologies including Mean stack development, Zend Framework for php and even some Ruby on Rails.   I have made some of my projects available on my portfolio at tahahojati.github.io.  If you would like to see the code for a project that is not available on Github, please contact me.  

%Thank you for considering my application.

%Sincerely,


\end{cvletter}
